As we saw in the tutorial video, in the README file it says to FIND the files accessible ONLY by the user

for that we can use the find command that conveniently gives us the opportunity to find file by user access and the command for that is

$> find / -user flag00 2>/dev/null


which gives the following results:

$> /usr/sbin/john
/rofs/usr/sbin/john

And when we look into both of the files they give the following results:

level00@SnowCrash:~$ cat /usr/sbin/john
cdiiddwpgswtgt

level00@SnowCrash:~$ cat /rofs/usr/sbin/john
cdiiddwpgswtgt


The result is a Caesar Cypther, more precisely it is a ROT 15.

you can easily decriptit by using an online tool such as https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher or https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher

The result of the rot 15 is : nottoohardhere

We can validate this flag and get the password for level00 by the following command:
level00@SnowCrash:~$ su flag00
password : nottoohardhere

Once we are in flag00 account, then get the next level password using the following command:

getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias

So the Password to connect to the account level01 is : x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias
