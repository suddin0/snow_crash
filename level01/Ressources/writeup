The encrypted flag is in the file /etc/passwd

when we see in the file we can see a strange line :

level01@SnowCrash:~$ cat /etc/passwd
             ...
flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash
             ...

and here we can see the an encrypted string : 42hDRfypTqqnw

We can use John The Ripper to decode this string.
To decrypt the string we save it in a file and use john the ripper to decode it.

$> echo "42hDRfypTqqnw" > pass
$> john pass --show

and it will give us the following result:

--------------------------------------------
?:abcdefg

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
--------------------------------------------

Thus revealing the decrypted flag : abcdefg

Now that we habe the flag we can now log in to flag01 account and get the password for level02 account.

## Use the decrypted password to login to flag01 account
level01@SnowCrash:~$ su flag01
Password: abcdefg

## Get the password for level02
flag01@SnowCrash:~$ getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : f2av5il02puano7naaf6adaaf

So the Password to connect to the account level02 is f2av5il02puano7naaf6adaaf
